Simple styles for making "redpill-esque" documents in RST.

I suggest putting something like this in your login script:

export RPLSTYLE=/home/mha/rpsvn/database/style
alias rpldoc="rst2pdf -c --stylesheet-path=$RPLSTYLE -s rpl.style $1"


I haven't found a way to make the include required in the RST file
be anything than a fully specified path yet, so you'll need to make it
a fully specified path. Should probably be able to fix that with a
pre-processor...
