Tools are all well and good BUT,

the 2vcl breach parser is not complete and is able to translate only some of
the mod_security rules. 
For this approach to be viable in the long term it would be best to rewrite
the parser with Parser Expression Grammars instead of the waterfall parser
currently implemented.

AND

The vfw-web webgui is not ported to VSF yet. You're welcome to port it ;-)
Only issue at present is that the log should be extracted from varnishlog
and not syslog, and is therefore presented in a different format.
