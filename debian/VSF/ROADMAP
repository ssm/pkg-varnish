=====================
 ROADMAP / TODO list
=====================

There is always more to be done in a security package :-)

Rules
=====
new stuff crops up all the time.
We want generic rules, rules that target specific attacks
as well as rulesets that are web-application specific

keeping rules up-to-date 
making appropriate rules case-insensitive (ebf0:gamelinux)
porting rules from mod_security           (comotion)
porting rules from VFW                    (escarpellini)

* HTTP RFC ensuring/enforcement.
* Generic/"WEB-1" threats:
--- Dir Traversal;
---  Internal file extensions (SO, Web, VCS, etc);
---  Unix/Windows commands;
---  Bad UA (scanners); 
* Load HTTP BODY (POST) - Prove Of Concept;
* Injection:
--- SQL Injection;
--- SSI Injection; 
* XSS;
* Automated tests;
* Simple Web Interface (Dashboard);
* Module for handle HTTP BODY (POST) - VMOD;
* HTTP BODY VMOD improvements:
--- Handle content-types (webservices);
---- XML;
---- JSON;
* Dynamic Blacklist (Redis, maybe);
--- AVScan (passive/bground).

Request parser
==============

 - iterate over header names and values
 - iterate over POST parameters
 - do other body validation

Web Interface
=============
 - We could use the basic VFW interface to use VSF
 - We could check options for other IDS/IPS Web UIs

Special-purpose modules
=======================

modules/cloak.vcl could be even cleverer
modules/request.vcl:
  awaiting vmod to iterate over headers...
  http 0.9 should send no headers!
todo maybe: 
  http 1.0 cannot have host, vary, warning, proxy-auth, content-md5, alternates,
Via,Upgrade, Etag, If-none-match, If-unmodified-since, if-match, cache-control, age,
  Range => content-range, expect, accept-encoding, TE, Transfer-encoding: chunked
(but we should prolly accept these anyway, or maybe wash them?)

Connection header incorrectly forwarded by 1.0 proxy.
